Implement a method for converting a Long value to int (primitive type) according to the following rules:

    if the given value is null the method should return the default value for ints;
    if the given value is greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE the method should return the max value for ints;
    if the given value is lesser than Integer.MIN_VALUE the method should return the min value for ints;
    otherwise, the method should return the same value as the passed argument.
