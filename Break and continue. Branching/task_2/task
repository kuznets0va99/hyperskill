Write a program in Java that asks the user for a single input, an integer 'n'. Your task is to print all even integers up to 'n'. However, if the integer 10 is encountered while printing, your program should skip the number 10 and the five numbers that follow it. Then, continue printing the remaining even numbers until 'n'.
