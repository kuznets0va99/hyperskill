You are given a class named BankAccount. The class has two fields: number and balance.

Define two classes which inherit from the BankAccount:

    CheckingAccount containing the double field fee.
    SavingsAccount containing the double field interestRate.

Each new class should have a constructor with three parameters to initialize all fields:

    CheckingAccount(String number, Long balance, double fee)
    SavingsAccount(String number, Long balance, double interestRate)

Do not forget to invoke the superclass constructor when creating objects.

Do not make the fields private
