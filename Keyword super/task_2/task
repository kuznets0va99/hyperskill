Create a base class called Shape with a constructor that takes the shape's name as a parameter. Then create a derived class called Rectangle that inherits from Shape and has a constructor that takes the shape's name, width, and height as parameters. The Rectangle constructor should call the base class constructor using the super keyword. Finally, create a Rectangle object and print out its name, width, and height.
