You're tasked with creating a simple Java method named 'countCharacters'. This method will read a single string from the standard input. The string would consist of any ASCII character. Your task is to calculate the total number of characters in the string and print it out. For example, if the input string was 'Hello, world!', your program should output '13'. Remember to include this method in the 'main' method of your program.
