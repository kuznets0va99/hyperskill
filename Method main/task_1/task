Create a Java program that prompts the user for an integer 'n' and prints the factorial of 'n'. Your program should consist of a main method where all your logic resides. Assume the input integer 'n' is non-negative. The main method should read from the standard input and print to the standard output. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be 120 since 1*2*3*4*5 = 120.
