You have five classes: Shape, Triangle, Circle, Square, and Rectangle. The class Shape has a method area(). This method does nothing. Override the method in all subclasses. Overridden methods should return an area of a particular figure. Use class fields for this.

The area of a triangle is S=bh/2S=bh/2 where hh is the height of the triangle, bb is the base of the triangle.

The area of a circle is S=πR2S=πR2 where RR is the radius of the circle. For ππ use the Math.PI constant.

The area of a square is S=s2S=s2 where ss is the length of the side of the square.

The area of a rectangle is S=whS=wh where ww is the width of the rectangle and hh the height of the rectangle.
