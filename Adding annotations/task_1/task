Create two classes named 'Animal' and 'Dog'. 'Animal' should have a single method 'makeSound' which when called, returns the string 'animal sound'. 'Dog' should be a subclass of 'Animal' and it should override the 'makeSound' method such that when the method 'makeSound' is called on an instance of 'Dog', it returns 'bark'. An annotation should be added to indicate that 'makeSound' method is being overridden in 'Dog' class. You will receive a single string input. If the input is 'Animal', create an instance of 'Animal' and print out the result of calling 'makeSound'. If the input is 'Dog', create an instance of 'Dog' and print out the result of calling 'makeSound'.
