Design a simple calculator program using functional decomposition. Create methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The main method should take two numbers and an operator as input, then call the appropriate method based on the operator. Handle division by zero and invalid operators. Input format: 'number1 operator number2' (e.g., '5 + 3'). Output the result of the operation.
