There is a method print(String arg). The method outputs the name and its argument (in " ", as it's a string). The output format for the string argument "test" is:

print("test")

Overload this method by writing a new method with the same name and two arguments: a string and an integer. The new method should print the name and both parameters, like this:

print("test", 4)

Do not remove the existing method!
