Write a program where you define two methods named 'calculate'. The first method takes two integer values as input, multiplies them, and returns the result. The second method takes three integer values as input, adds the first two numbers, multiples the result with the third number, and returns it. Your main program should call these methods based on the number of inputs provided. You must read a string of integers from standard input. The string will either have two or three integers separated by a space. Depending on the number of numbers in the input, make a call to the appropriate method and print the output.
