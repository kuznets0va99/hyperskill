Given an integer input, write a Java program that computes the following: divide the number by 2 and display the remainder, then multiply the result by 3 and display the result. The input will be a single integer 'n' (0 ≤ n ≤ 100). Print two lines where the first line shows the remainder of the number divided by 2 and the second line shows the result of the remainder multiplied by 3.
