Take a look at the method that takes a string, converts all characters of the string to upper case, and then returns the resulting string.

But there is a problem. Sometimes an input string is null. As you already know, in this case, the method throws a NullPointerException.

Your task is to fix the method in order to avoid an NPE.

If the input string is null, the method should return the empty string "".
