Create a type-safe Box class that has a single instance variable for the type it's defined with, alongside an appropriate constructor. Implement a method named get that will return the value. Then, you will be provided with a string, integer or a float. Your task is to put the provided value into an object of Box and then print its value. Note that the box should be able to hold any data type. The input will be a single line of either string, integer or float and your output should be the same value.
