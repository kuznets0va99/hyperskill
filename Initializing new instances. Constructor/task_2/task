There are two classes: Account with three fields (code, balance, owner) and User with three fields (login, firstName, lastName). Both classes have parameterized constructors. See the full declarations of these classes in the code template. Do not be afraid of the static keyword. It's not important now.

In the main method, create an instance of the Account class and pass it to the process method by calling process(account). This method is already defined.

The instance must have the following values of the fields:

    code: "123456",
    balance: 1000,
    owner: (login: "demo-user", firstName: "Alexander", lastName: "Schmidt").

Note that the owner is an instance of the User class.

See the provided template, do not change it.
