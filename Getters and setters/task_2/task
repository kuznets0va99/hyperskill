Create a default class named 'Book' that represents a book in a library. The class should contain three private properties: 'title' (String), 'author' (String), and 'numberOfPages' (int). The class should also contain public methods to set (mutator) and get (accessor) these properties. The mutator methods should not allow to set an empty string for 'title' and 'author,' or a negative or zero value for 'numberOfPages'. Instead, if such a value is attempted to be set, the methods should keep the properties unchanged. Once the class is created, create an object of this class, set the properties using the mutator methods and get values using the accessor methods. Take three lines of input, the first line is a string (title), the second line is also a string (author), and the third line is an integer (numberOfPages). The output should be three lines, printing the title, author, and the number of pages in the same order.
